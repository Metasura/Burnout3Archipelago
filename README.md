## ⚠️ WARNING
- You need a Burnout 3 US ISO (`SLUS-21050`).
- You need PCSX2 Lastest Stable (`v2.6.3`). (Nightly doesn't work for some reason)
- Generation might fail, we are unsure why yet, just retry.
- After each Race or Crash go back to the main menu (If you don't you might see location that you don't have/don't see ones you do).

## PCSX2 Settings
- Enable PINE in PCSX2
  - In PCSX2, Under Tools, **Check** Show Advanced Settings
  - In PCSX2, System ---> Settings ---> Advanced tab ---> PINE Settings, **Check** Enable and ensure Slot is set to 28011
